# Filters comparison
This repository is contain the project developed for the course "Gpu Computing" @ Unimi.

This project compares the classic sequential implementation with different parallel version of some computer vision filters (Robert, Module and Canny); each implementation uses different features offered by the framework Cuda (shared memory, streams, etc).

To build it, you can use Visual Studio (with Nsight) or you can compile the main file in the folder "GpuComputingProject".
